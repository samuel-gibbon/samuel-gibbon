## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

## Overview

---

I'm a UK Research & Innovation funded PhD student in Clinical Brain Science at the University of Edinburgh.

My research focuses on the development of deep learning models for the analysis of retinal imaging data. I am particularly interested in the application of these models to the study of neurodegenerative diseases, such as Parkinson's, small vessel disease, and stroke.

Before coming to Edinburgh, I worked as a Research Assistant at the University of Cambridge. I completed an MSc in Psychological Research at the University of Edinburgh in 2015, and a BA in Linguistics in 2012.

**Skills:** Python, R, MATLAB, Data Analysis, Statistics, Linux, Git, Project Management, Presenting.
